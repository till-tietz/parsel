Title: Parallelized Dynamic Web-Scraping Using RSelenium
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Till", "Tietz", email = "ttietz2014@gmail.com", role = c("cre","aut")))
Description: A system to increase the efficiency of dynamic web-scraping with 'RSelenium'
    by leveraging parallel processing. You provide a function wrapper for your 'RSelenium' 
    scraping routine with a set of inputs, and 'parsel' runs it in several browser instances. 
    Chunked input processing as well as error catching and logging ensures seamless 
    execution and minimal data loss, even when unforeseen 'RSelenium' errors occur.
