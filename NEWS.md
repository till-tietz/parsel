#parsel 0.2.0

* Added 'RSelenium' constructor functions. These functions are wrappers around 'RSelenium' methods that allow you to quickly and easily render safe, ready to use
'RSelenium' scraping code to the console and paste it into your scraping functions. 
Constructors can be piped together via `%>>%` to allow for intuitive, sequential 
construction of scraping code. 


# parsel 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
